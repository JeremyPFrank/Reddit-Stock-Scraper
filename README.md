# Reddit-Stock-Scraper
This is a Python script I wrote as a personal project. I've always been interested in finances, stocks, and how social media can play a role in shaping how people view them. I've even done some academic research on the very subject, investigating how college students use social media to inform and shape their investment decisions. This program scrapes a list of Reddit communities and compiles a list of stock tickers mentioned and discussed. The program then counts the number of times each ticker is mentioned in all comments on all posts in all subreddits. The code currently only iterates through all posts and comments from the day during which the program is run, however, it can be easily modified to cover any timeframe. Market statistics are then fetched for all listed stocks from google finance. While currently, the listed statistics are limited, any user can easily modify and adjust the fetched statistics for whatever goal they seek. The current academic literature, along with more anecdotal evidence (GameStop, Cryptocurrency, etc.) have proven social media has the ability to affect financial markets. Understanding what stocks are being discussed during any given day could prove invaluable to investors looking to find successful and promising investments. The project is written in Python and utilizes packages such as Praw, yFinance, and Datetime.
