# Reddit-Stock-Scraper
This is a python script I wrote as a personal project. I've always been interested in finances, stocks, and how social media can play a role in shaping how people view them. I've even done some academic research on the very subject, investigating how college students use social media to inform and shape their investment decisions. This program scrapes a list of reddit communities and compiles a list of stock tickers mentioned and discussed. The program than counts the amount of times each ticker is mentioned in all comments on all posts in all subreddits. The code currently only iteratres through all posts and comments from the day during which the program is run, however it can be easily modified to cover any timeframe.
